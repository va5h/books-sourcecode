<p>The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a 
coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It 
depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of 
about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. 
Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of 
times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off 
during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate 
Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a 
varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the 
way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face 
gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that 
the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the 
caption beneath it ran.</p>

<p>Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away 
about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The 
telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, 
above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so 
long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, 
he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether 
you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the 
Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even 
conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could 
plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live -- did live, from 
habit that became instinct -- in the assumption that every sound you made was 
overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.</p>
