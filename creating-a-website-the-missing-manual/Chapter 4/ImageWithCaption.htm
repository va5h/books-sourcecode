<br /><i>The bark of a plane tree</i></span>
Plane trees are among the most numerous large street and park trees
planted in Greater London. The tree is commonly known as the 'plane'
in England and as 'sycamore' in North America. They belong to the
genus Platanus, family Platanaceae.
</p>
<p>The botanic Latin name 'Platanus' is derived from an original
Greek term, 'platanos', referring to the broad leaves. The common
English name 'plane' is derived from this or its more modern
derivatives in other European languages.
